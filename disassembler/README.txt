This python code disassembles a subset of the Intel 32 instruction set machine code into assembly.

This code was tested on Windows 7 using Python 3.6.3. The code can be executed by calling
the runDisassember.py file. No arguments are required. This file specifies the binary input 
file to use for disassembly. The binary input file must be located in the same directory as 
the runDisassembler.py file. No output file is produced, as the program's output is simply 
printed to standard output.
